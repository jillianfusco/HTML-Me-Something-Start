        <h2>My Education Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Languages and Cultures from West
          Chester University in 2017, majoring in German with a minor in
          Spanish. As part of the immersion requirement, I had the privilege of
          studying abroad at ActiLingua Academy in Vienna, Austria, for four
          weeks. During this time, I completed C1-level courses, significantly
          enhancing my language proficiency and cultural understanding.
          <br />
          Upon graduation, one of my professors informed me about an opportunity
          to teach German at the West Chester Area School District. I was hired
          based on my bachelor's degree and granted an emergency teaching
          certificate by the state, allowing me to teach while pursuing my
          formal teaching certification. Over the next two years, I attended
          graduate-level classes after work to complete the requirements for my
          teaching certificate.

        <h2>Traveling to Germany with Students</h2>
        <p>
          In 2022, I had the incredible opportunity to travel to Germany with my
          colleague and a group of 25 high school students. During our ten day
          trip we visited the cities Heidelberg, Ettal, Ulm, and Munich. My most
          memorable experiences were a bike ride along the Danube and a trip to
          the top of the Zugspitze, Germany's tallest mountain.

        <h2>Getting My Own Classroom</h2>

        <p>
          My first 4 years of teaching I was a guest in other teachers'
          classrooms. After 4 years I finally got my own classroom to decorate
          and call my own!

        <h2>Leaving Teaching</h2>

        <p>
          Throughout my tenure at the West Chester School District, I embraced
          the unique challenge of being a traveling teacher, moving between 2-3
          school buildings each day. This role required juggling the varying
          schedules of each school, especially when middle and high schools had
          different start times. Despite these challenges, the experience
          allowed me to grow professionally and adapt to diverse educational
          environments and develop tools to become extremely organized and
          proactive. However, coupled with the myriad challenges of being a
          post-pandemic teacher, I ultimately decided to transition out of the
          profession in early 2023. Reflecting on these challenges, I came
          across an article that deeply resonated with my experiences:
        </p>

          <h4>People Don't Want to Be Teachers Anymore. Can You Blame Them?</h4>
          <h5>by Jesse Grose</h5>
          <time datetime="2023-09-13">September 13, 2023</time>
          <p>
            &quot;The current state of the teaching profession is at or near its
            lowest levels in 50 years,” according to a working paper published
            in November by the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown
            University.<br />
            When I spoke to Kraft, he said that while we're in a 'moment of
            really acute crisis' right now, the 'trend of declining respect and
            interest and entry and satisfaction in the profession' isn't new —
            it started more than a decade ago. He said that while it's tough to
            pinpoint, the cause is partly a combination of stagnant real wages
            for teachers while wages were rising in other sectors for
            college-educated workers, the increasing cost of higher education in
            general, and declining respect for the profession overall.&quot;

        <h2>Learning Programming</h2>
        <p>
          Reflecting on my teaching career, my favorite aspects were creating
          materials for my classes and mentoring students. I brainstormed ways
          to continue making things and teaching/mentoring and decided to become
          a web developer. I spent a few months doing self-paced courses like
          Scrimba and Zero to Mastery.

        <h4>Here are some of my projects!</h4>

          <p>
            Kitty Cart was the culmination of the first JavaScript unit in
            Scrimba. It connects to a database so multiple people can use it
            simultaneously. I use it with my partner to keep our grocery list.

        <p>
          While both Srimba and ZTM were excellent introductions to web dev, I
          realized I needed something more structured and resource-rich.<br />

          After posting one of my projects on LinkedIn, a friend messaged me
          about an amazing free course from a nonprofit called
          <a href="https://launchcode.org/" target="_blank"> LaunchCode</a>,
          which happened to be accepting applications for their web development
          course. I was thrilled to be accepted and earn a spot, which I later
          learned had about a 20% acceptance rate. <br />

          I've been a LaunchCode student for almost three months now, and I
          can't believe how much I've learned in such a short amount of time.
          The class is very challenging, and the pace is intense, but I'm so
          glad I stuck with it because I've learned so much and feel confident
          that by the end of it, I'll be ready for an internship.
          <br />

          LaunchCode is split into three sections: learning JavaScript, learning
          Java, and what they call Liftoff, which includes career and interview
          preparation along with portfolio development. I'm nearing the end of
          the JavaScript section, currently working on HTML and CSS, and about
          to jump into learning React. It's been a great experience so far.
          <br />

          My favorite part of LaunchCode is the integrated community. I love
          having access to my classmates via Slack, and I have two amazing
          instructional assistants to answer questions and review my coding
          assignments with me. This supportive environment has been invaluable
          in my learning journey, providing both guidance and camaraderie.
